# Close to nature

Hello everyone, have you ever gone out to close to nature this week? Have you ever gone out to buy something or get your package?

 

Today I am going to tell you my story which is about closing to nature. One day, I called my Mom after dinner, I said to Mom, “Have you had dinner?” My mom said to me, “Yes, of course. What were you doing recently?” I said, “Well, recently I stayed at home to read books, use my computer to work, play phone, cook delicious food, etc.” My mom said to me, “your life was colorful. How long didn’t you go out and stroll?” I replied, “Just 5 days”. My mom said to me, “What? It was been a long time. You’ve got to go out and stroll. It was quite important for you to keep healthy. Remembered to close to nature and feel the power of nature.” I said to my mom, “All right, tomorrow I was going to go out and stroll and close to nature and feel it.”

 

For this thing, I wrote a plan. I decided to stroll three times every day if it was sunny. Such as morning, noon and evening. The second day was coming, I got up and went out with my mask. I felt very comfortable when I went out. Secretly, I took off my mask and had a very deep breath. The air was so fresh that I didn’t want to wear my mask. Next, I strolled around my neighbourhood over pure music, and received the radiation from the earth. Meanwhile, I did some exercise when I strolled. I spent 30min on it. Meanwhile, I saw the bud of plant and recorded via my phone, I heard the bird, I felt the wind and I felt quite comfortable when the sun rose. I couldn’t see the sunrise, but I could enjoy the sunset. It was longer than sunrise. It was extremely beautiful. I loved it.

 

One day, I couldn’t sleep tight after I went out. I made mistakes resulted in that I couldn’t sleep until midnight. Because I watched a passionate speech, and I thought that speech was very encouraged. I learnt a lot from it. The name of the speech was [*What Bruce Lee can teach us about living fully*](https://www.ted.com/talks/shannon_lee_what_bruce_lee_can_teach_us_about_living_fully). It was quite got a message. After that, I decided to listen to quiet music before I slept, and watched passionate speeches in days. **Or** you can’t sleep at midnight. It’s very harmful for your health.

 

No matter how busy you are, no matter how tired you are, no matter how sad you are, don’t forget to go out to close to nature, to see and smell the flowers, to observe plants, to hear the voice of nature, to breath the fresh air, to feel the wind, to see the sunrise and sunset. Meanwhile, try your best to sleep early and get up early, it’s very useful for you to keep your body heath. Note that you’d better to listen to quiet music before you sleep. Do not watch passionate speeches or dramatic series. And the most importantly, do not turn on your washing machine when your neighbors are sleeping. All in all, remember to receive the radiation from the earth everyday and obey the rule of nature, close to nature, back to nature.

 

Thank you.
