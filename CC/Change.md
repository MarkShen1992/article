# Change

Hello, everyone. Today I want to share something about sleep. When I was a freshman, I used to sleep at 11:30pm, sometimes daybreak. I thought I’m still young. I didn’t care about it. But I got uneasy when I washed my hair. I found there were a lot of shedding hair in the water. Oh my god, what happened? I realized I have got to change. But I had no idea about this. Until one day, I come across a professor. I told her about my situation. she recommended me a Chinese physician. I went to the clinic that weekend.

 

When I arrived at that clinic, I registered firstly and I went to the second floor to see the doctor. She said, “Boy, come on and have a seat.” I walked towards the seat and sat. She said, “You sleep a little late recently, right?” I said, “Yes, how do you know that?”. She said, “I read from your face and your hair. Meanwhile, I advise you to go to bed earlier. I know it’s a little hard for you to sleep at 9:00pm, but 10:00pm is ok, right?” I said, ”well, I have a try. Can I get the reason why I do this?” She said, “The sunrise makes, the sunset but the rest in the past. Generally speaking, people go to sleep at 9:00pm and get up at 3:00am in the past. If you have something unfinished, you can do those things next morning and it’s very quiet at that time.” I said, “I learned from you. But I can’t do that at the beginning.” She said, “Even though, you have to lie on the bed and close your eyes. You will sleep for a while. If you do this, it’s very good for your health yet, understand?” I said, “yes”. Then she gave me prescription and I took it to get my drug and went back.

 

I followed the advice the doctor mentioned, I went to sleep at 10:00pm even though I can’t sleep at the beginning. But gradually I was used to sleeping at 10:00pm and getting up at 5:00am and experienced the benefit of this lifestyle. Until now, I keep it. It brings me a lot. First, I have more time to do something interesting. Second, when I washed my hair, I found there’s less shedding hair in the water. Third, there are less acne on my face. So everyone, do you want to be a beautify girl or a handsome boy and have more time to do something you like? Making a change like me in 2020.



Thank you!
